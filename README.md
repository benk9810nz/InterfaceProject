# Interface Project - HCI Interface Assignment
This Repository contains Assignment Material from my HCI Inteface Project. 

During my last year of study at the Southern Institute of Technology I was tasked with creating a Mobile Application Concept. Due to the current situation of the country being in Level 4 Covid 19 Lockdown, I created the concept of a Covid Tracer Application which would allow users to record their locations (checking in & out), while also allowing them to see the latest information regarding the latest Covid 19 Cases within the application. I created this concept before many similar apps were released allowing users to record their application, and during the creation of this documentation analyised the components of these other applications to justify some of their pros and cons, and how my app conceptulisaton. would stand out compared with them.

This Repository contains 2 Files. The PDF Contains the Documentation (worth 40% of the mark), while the XD File contains the fully functional prototype of the application, created in Adobe XD (worth the remaning 60% of the mark). 

### For this assignment I got a mark of 99/100, with the below comments from the tutor regarding it:

> A very comprehensive and polished project and documentation. Aligns closely with the material presented in class, by using HCI specific terminology, and overt references to the tools and techniques used that were learned in class.
> Sneaky but very amusing use of comic sans on the I icon, and I believe also on the checkout reminder!
> This project meets the assignment instructions very well and would be a very professional piece of work to produce to a client, or as part of a business plan for a start-up seeking investment as it shows excellent planning and understanding of the processes involved an app interface design. Well done!
